# training_tracker

Project aim is to deliver a product that will track your progress in gym/pool/running and make a competition with your friends or anyone registered in the system.

Also as a secondary aim stands the learning of web technologies.

Now I use: Node.js, Bootstrap 3.0, JQuery, Express.

In plans: AngularJS (or some other framework), Socket.io and also integration of tools like Bower, Grunt, Yeoman etc.
